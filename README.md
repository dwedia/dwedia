# Dwedia

### About me:

- I am a Linux Systemsadministrator, currently working in the healthcare sector

- I am a cat enthusiast, who currently shares my home with 4 cats

- I am a firm believer in the need to keep learning, and this leads me to experiment with al sorts of projects. Many of them fail, but I learn from them.

 - <img align="left" alt="Linux" width="30px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/ansible/ansible-original.svg" /> I try to implement Ansible as a way of managing servers and services whereever I can, both at work, and in my private homelab. This challenges me to keep learning more and more about Ansible
