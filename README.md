### About me:

- ðŸ˜„ I am a Linux Systemsadministrator, currently working in the healthcare sector

- ðŸ˜¸ I am a cat enthusiast, who currently shares my home with 4 cats

- ðŸ“• I am a firm believer in the need to keep learning, and this leads me to experiment with al sorts of projects. Many of them fail, but I learn from them.

- ðŸŽ§ While working, I can often be seen to be headbanging slightly to Heavy Metal Music.
